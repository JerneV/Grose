# Grose

## Yet another shopping list

This project tries to emulate what Google's `myshoppinglist` did before it was killed by Google. (<https://killedbygoogle.com/>)
I created it using Svelte and Vite.

To run it locally I use:
`bun run dev`

On commit the Github pages get updated if build is successful.

That's about it.
