# Grose

## Yet another shopping list

This project tries to emulate what Google's `myshoppinglist` did before it was killed by Google. (<https://killedbygoogle.com/>)
I created it using Svelte and Vite.

To run it locally I use:
`bun run dev`
And to update the Github pages I do:

```shell
bun run build
bun run deploy
```

That's about it.
